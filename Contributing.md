# Contributing Guide

You can directly edit(add/delete) the [README.md](./README.md) file for contribution. If you don't know how to edit the file, please leave a message to the [Issue board](https://github.com/choya-lee/yolo-papers/issues).

## Edit the list

You can **add** / **delete**  the papers on the list. Please sort by year.

### Addition

Please provide **enough descriptions** when you push a request, it should preferably be a paper with a high number of citations.

Here is an example of markdown code for a paper on the list.

`You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection (2016), J. Redmon et al. [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640)`

The pdf link which can directly download the pdf file rather than links to another webpage is preferred. If the number of authors are more than two, please write the first author's name only.

### Deletion
If a paper seems to be out-of-date or be a duplication of another paper, you can suggest deletion. Deletion is also an important contribution to maintain a tractable number of papers on the awesome list.
